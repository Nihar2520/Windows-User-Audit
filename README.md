# Windows-User-Audit

A simple PowerShell-based tool for monitoring **local user accounts** and **privileged group membership** changes on Windows systems.  
The tool can:

- Take a snapshot of all local users and group memberships  
- Compare two snapshots to highlight changes  
- Run a test harness that creates and deletes a dummy user to verify detection  

---

## üìÇ Scripts

- **LocalUserSnapshot.ps1**  
  Takes a snapshot of current local users and groups.

  Output is saved as JSON under:
  C:\Users<User>\Documents\UserAudit\snapshots\local\

- **`diff_snapshots.ps1`**  
Compares two snapshot JSON files and shows:
- Added/removed users  
- Changes to the **Administrators** group  

- **`test_harness_local.ps1`**  
End-to-end test. Creates a temporary user, adds it to Administrators, captures before/after snapshots, shows the diff, then cleans up.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (or Windows Server with PowerShell 5+)  
- PowerShell 5.1+ (comes preinstalled on modern Windows)  
- **Administrator rights** required for:
- Creating/removing test users (harness script)  
- Capturing complete group memberships  

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Clone or download


2. Unblock the scripts (only once per file)

Windows may block downloaded scripts. Unblock them before running:

Unblock-File -Path .\LocalUserSnapshot.ps1
Unblock-File -Path .\diff_snapshots.ps1
Unblock-File -Path .\test_harness_local.ps1

3. Take a snapshot
.\LocalUserSnapshot.ps1


This saves a JSON snapshot under your Documents folder.

4. Compare snapshots

Take two snapshots (before/after a change) and compare:
```powershell
.\diff_snapshots.ps1 -OldFile "snapshots\local\local_snapshot_20250920T120000Z.json" `
                     -NewFile "snapshots\local\local_snapshot_20250920T121000Z.json"
```

Example output:
```powershell
=== Users ===
Added users:
 - audit_test_user
Removed users: none

=== Administrators group ===
Added to Administrators:
 - YOURPC\audit_test_user
Removed from Administrators: none

5. Run test harness (Admin only)
# Open PowerShell as Administrator
.\test_harness_local.ps1

```
This will automatically:

Save a ‚Äúbefore‚Äù snapshot

Create a dummy user audit_test_user

Add it to Administrators

Save an ‚Äúafter‚Äù snapshot

Run diff to show the change

Clean up the test user

üîí Security Notes

Inspect scripts before running. Only use on systems you control.

Run LocalUserSnapshot.ps1 without admin if you don‚Äôt need elevated privileges.

Prefer Unblock-File over Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass to avoid enabling unknown scripts globally.

Test harness is for lab/testing only (creates/deletes accounts).

For safety, try in a VM or disposable test environment.

Do you also want me to add a **‚ÄúDemo‚Äù section with screenshots of the script output** so your README looks more professional on GitHub?
